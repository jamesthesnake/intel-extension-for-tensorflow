Intel® Extension for TensorFlow* is a heterogeneous, high performance deep learning extension plugin based on TensorFlow [PluggableDevice](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20200624-pluggable-device-for-tensorflow.md) interface to bring Intel XPU(GPU, CPU, etc) devices into [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) open source community for AI workload acceleration. It allows flexibly plugging an XPU into TensorFlow on-demand, and exposing computing power inside Intel's hardware.

This diagram provides a summary of the TensorFlow* PyPI package ecosystem.
